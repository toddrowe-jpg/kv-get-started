# BITX Capital Blog Style Guide

## Introduction
This style guide provides comprehensive guidelines for writing, formatting, and editing content for the BITX Capital blog. Adhering to these conventions ensures consistency, clarity, and professionalism in all blog posts.

## Writing Conventions
- **Voice and Tone**: Use a professional yet approachable voice. The tone should be informative, engaging, and supportive, tailored to our audience of finance enthusiasts and professionals.
- **Person**: Generally, use the third person. Occasionally, second person may be used for direct engagement (e.g., "you can find more details below").
- **Clarity**: Strive for clarity in every sentence. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and provide explanations for complex concepts.
- **Contractions**: Use contractions (e.g., "don’t", "it’s") to maintain a conversational tone.

## Formatting
- **Headings**: Use headings and subheadings (H1, H2, H3) to organize content. Ensure headings are descriptive and reflect the content hierarchy.
- **Paragraphs**: Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences) to enhance readability. Each paragraph should focus on a single idea.
- **Bullet Points and Numbering**: Use bullet points for lists to improve clarity. Numbered lists can be used for step-by-step instructions.

## Editorial Standards
- **Grammar and Punctuation**: Follow standard English grammar rules. Use the Oxford comma for clarity.
- **Spelling**: Prefer American English spelling (e.g., "organization" rather than "organisation").
- **Citations and References**: Include citations for data and quotes. Use footnotes or links where appropriate.
- **Images and Multimedia**: All images should be relevant, high-quality, and properly credited. Include alt text for all images for accessibility.
